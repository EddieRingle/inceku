Inceku README
Inceku Version: 0alpha

You will need to build the CrissCross library before compiling this,
you can get a copy via Git at:
http://github.com/tycho/crisscross/
Or, you can get a copy via SVN at:
http://crisscross.googlecode.com/
*NOTE*: The SVN repo may not be as up-to-date as the Git repo,
you have been warned!
CrissCross also requires CMake, which you can get at:
http://cmake.org/
CMake can also be installed via APT for Debian-based Linux Distros:
sudo apt-get install cmake

First off, when I develop this on my machine,
the directory structure is layed out like this:

/
/crisscross
/crisscross/source
/crisscross/source/crisscross
/inceku

This means that the includes are set to reflect this setup.
Please consider this before building. :)
