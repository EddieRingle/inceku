Inceku README
Inceku Version: 0alpha

You will need to build the CrissCross library before compiling this,
you can get a copy via Git at:
http://github.com/tycho/crisscross/
Or, you can get a copy via SVN at:
http://crisscross.googlecode.com/
*NOTE*: The SVN repo may not be as up-to-date as the Git repo,
you have been warned!

CrissCross also requires CMake, which you can get at:
http://cmake.org/
CMake can also be installed via APT for Debian-based Linux Distros:
sudo apt-get install cmake

When compiling from source taken from the git repo, you only do:
cmake .
make check
make

You should then get a Inceku binary. Modify inceku.conf to setup your server and run Inceku.
